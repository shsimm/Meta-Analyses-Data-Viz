# Differential Expression Effect Size Analyses

This repository contains the code to examine the effect sizes from stasitical differential expression models from a limma-voom output (_see Differential Expression Analyses_) for statistical models

There are **eight** analyses here 
1) Meta-Analysis Aggregation 
2) Volcano Plotting of Meta-Analysis Results
3) Volcano Plotting of Mega-Analysis Results
4) Single-Gene Plotting
5) Gene Ontology Enrichment Analyses
6) Semantic Clustering Analyses

There are **four** files here
1) Analysis of the Gene Expression Signature of Reported Race (limma_race.Rmd)
3) Analysis of the Gene Expression Signature of Reported Race-by-Dx Interaction (limma_interaction.Rmd)
4) Analysis of the Gene Expression Signature of Dx (limma_dx.Rmd)
5) Driver Script (term_functions_driver.Rmd)
