# Differential Expression Effect Size Analyses

These examine the effect sizes of interest (_see Differential Expression Analyses for statitical models_)

There are **eight** analyses here 
1) meta-analysis aggregation of cohort-sepcific differential expression analyses
2) volcano plotting of meta-analysis
3) volcano plotting of mega-analysis
4) single-gene plotting
5) gene ontology enrichments
6) semantic clustering of differentially enriched gene ontologies

There are **four** files here
1) Analysis of the Gene Expression Signature of Reported Race (limma_race)
3) Analysis of the Gene Expression Signature of Reported Race-by-Dx Interaction (limma_interaction)
4) Analysis of the Gene Expression Signature of Dx (limma_dx)
5) Driver Script (term_functions_driver)
